# Collecting Docker container logs

With SigNoz you can collect all your docker container logs and perform different queries on top of it.
Below are the steps to collect docker container logs.


## Collect Syslogs in SigNoz cloud

### Setup Otel Collector as agent

  * Add  `config.yaml`
    ```yaml {22-26}
    receivers:
      filelog:
        include: [ /tmp/python.log ]
        start_at: beginning
        operators:
          - type: json_parser
            timestamp:
              parse_from: attributes.time
              layout: '%Y-%m-%d,%H:%M:%S %z'
          - type: move
            from: attributes.message
            to: body
          - type: remove
            field: attributes.time
    processors:
      batch:
        send_batch_size: 10000
        send_batch_max_size: 11000
        timeout: 10s
    exporters:
      otlp:
        endpoint: "ingest.{region}.signoz.cloud:443"
        tls:
          insecure: false
        headers:
          "signoz-access-token": "<SIGNOZ_INGESTION_KEY>"
    service:
      pipelines:
        logs:
          receivers: [filelog]
          processors: [batch]
          exporters: [ otlp/log ]

  ```
  Depending on the choice of your region for SigNoz cloud, the otlp endpoint will vary according to this table.

  | Region | Endpoint                   |
  | ------ | -------------------------- |
  | US     | ingest.us.signoz.cloud:443 |
  | IN     | ingest.in.signoz.cloud:443 |
  | EU     | ingest.eu.signoz.cloud:443 |
  
* We will start our otel-collector container.
  ```bash
  docker run -d --name signoz-host-otel-collector -p 2255:2255 --user root -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/etc/otel/config.yaml signoz/signoz-otel-collector:0.79.0
  ```

### Run logspout to collect docker container logs and send it to local otel collector.

Logspout helps in collecting Docker logs by connecting to Docker socket.

* Run logspout 
  ```bash
  docker run --net=host --rm --name="logspout" \
          --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
          gliderlabs/logspout \
          syslog+tcp://<host>:2255
  ```

  For finding the right host for your SigNoz cluster please follow the guide [here](../install/troubleshooting.md#signoz-otel-collector-address-grid).  

* If there are no errors your logs will be exported and will be visible on the SigNoz UI.
  


## Collect Syslogs in Self-Hosted SigNoz

###  Steps for collecting logs if SigNoz is running on the same host.
Once you deploy SigNoz in docker, it will automatically start collecting logs of all the docker containers, except for the container logs of SigNoz. 

#### Disable automatic container log collection.
You can disable automatic container logs collection by modifying the `otel-collector-config.yaml` file which is present inside `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup`

  ```yaml {5}
  ...
  service:
    pipelines:
      logs:
        receivers: [otlp]
        processors: [batch]
        exporters: [clickhouselogsexporter]
  ...
  ```
  Here we have modified the value of receivers from `[otlp, tcplog/docker]` to `[otlp]`.
  Now you can restart SigNoz and the changes will be applied.

#### Filter/Exclude logs
If you want to exclude certain logs you can exclude them based the container name or based on pattern.

* **Using container name** : We will modify the `tcplog/docker` reciever in `otel-collector-config.yaml` file which is present inside `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup` and add a new operator after `signoz_logs_filter`
  ```yaml {2}
  ...
  - type: filter
    expr: 'attributes.container_name matches "^(<container_name>|<container_name>)'
  ...
  ```
  Replace `<container_name>` with the name of the containers that you want to exclude.

  If you want to collect logs of signoz containers you can remove the names of signoz containers from the filter operator with id `signoz_logs_filter` operator.

* **Based on pattern** : You can also use the filter operator to filter out logs based on a pattern
  ```yaml {3-6}
  ....
    operators:
      - type: filter
        expr: 'body matches "^LOG: .* END$"'
        drop_ratio: 1.0
  ....
  ```
  Here we are matching logs using an expression and dropping the entire log by setting `drop_ratio: 1.0` . You can read more about the filter operator [here](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/blob/main/pkg/stanza/docs/operators/filter.md)

* Now we can restart the otel collector container so that new changes are applied and the docker container logs will be dropped for the specified containers.

### Steps for collecting logs if SigNoz is running on a different host.

If you have a signoz running on a different host then you can run logspout on the host and send logs to SigNoz cluster.

* Expose port `2255` of otel-collector by modifying the `docker-compose.yaml` file present inside `deploy/docker/clickhouse-setup`
  ```yaml {6}
  ...
  otel-collector:
      image: signoz/signoz-otel-collector:latest
      command: ["--config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml"]
      ports:
        - "2255:2255"
  ```

* Run logspout 
  ```bash
  docker run --net=host --rm --name="logspout" \
          --volume=/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
          gliderlabs/logspout \
          syslog+tcp://<host>:2255

  ```

  For finding the right host for your SigNoz cluster please follow the guide [here](../install/troubleshooting.md#signoz-otel-collector-address-grid).  

* If there are no errors your logs will be exported and visible on the SigNoz UI.
