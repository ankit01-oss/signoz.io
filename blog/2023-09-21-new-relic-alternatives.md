Are you looking for a New Relic alternative? Then you have come to the right place. New Relic is a comprehensive observability tool. But it might be too complex for your use case, or you might have been bugged by its complex pricing policies like user seats-based pricing.

New Relic provides an array of tools for monitoring and observability. But it’s not meant for everyone. New Relic’s user pricing can go up to $549/user. Even for teams with 10-15 devs, the cost becomes significant. At scale, the cost of adding users can go up to 66% of the total bill. ([Learn more](https://signoz.io/blog/pricing-comparison-signoz-vs-datadog-vs-newrelic-vs-grafana/#no-user-based-pricing-collaborate-seamlessly-with-signoz))

As a legacy tool, users are also getting stuck with its documentation and tooling.

In this article, we'll explore the top 7 alternatives to New Relic.

## Top New Relic Alternatives

1. [SigNoz (Open-Source)](#signoz-open-source)
2. [AppDynamics](#appdynamics)
3. [Dynatrace](#dynatrace)
4. [Datadog](#datadog)
5. [Instana](#instana)
6. [AppOptics (Solarwinds)](#appoptics-solarwinds)
7. [Sematext](#sematext)

## SigNoz (Open-Source)

[SigNoz](https://signoz.io/) is a great New Relic alternative that is open-source and provides three signals in a single pane of glass. You can monitor logs, metrics, and traces and correlate signals for better insights into application performance. 

One of the biggest benefits of using SigNoz over New Relic is adding as many team members as you like to improve collaboration. ([Learn more](https://signoz.io/comparisons/signoz-vs-newrelic/).)

With SigNoz, you can do the following:

- Visualise Traces, Metrics, and Logs in a single pane of glass
- Monitor application metrics like p99 latency, error rates for your services, external API calls, and individual endpoints.
- Find the root cause of the problem by going to the exact traces which are causing the problem and see detailed flamegraphs of individual request traces.
- Run aggregates on trace data to get business-relevant metrics
- Filter and query logs, build dashboards and alerts based on attributes in logs
- Monitor infrastructure metrics such as CPU utilization or memory usage
- Record exceptions automatically in Python, Java, Ruby, and Javascript
- Easy to set alerts with DIY query builder

SigNoz is built to support OpenTelemetry natively. OpenTelemetry is <a href = "https://www.cncf.io/projects/opentelemetry/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" >backed</a> by Cloud Native Computing Foundation and is the second most active project after Kubernetes in the CNCF landscape. OpenTelemetry frees you from vendor lock-in and offers a host of other benefits.

SaaS vendors like New Relic and Datadog [do not support OpenTelemetry data well](https://signoz.io/blog/is-opentelemetry-a-first-class-citizen-in-your-dashboard-a-datadog-and-newrelic-comparison/).  If you want to use OpenTelemetry, then SigNoz is a much better choice than New Relic.

## Choosing the right New Relic Alternative

Monitoring and observability are critical components that you can't ignore for your applications in the production environment. As such, choosing the right tool which can empower you to take actions proactively is very important. Though New Relic is a good tool, it has its own challenges, including legacy docs, complex pricing policies, and complex UI.

The above New Relic alternatives can be an excellent option to meet your monitoring needs. 

A tool like [SigNoz](https://signoz.io/comparisons/signoz-vs-newrelic/) can be a great alternative to New Relic with its comprehensive features and transparent pricing policies.
